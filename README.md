Project was created in [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad)

![Default view of hex standoff](images/base.jpg)

You can configure parameters of:
- top pin
- distance between the halves of a top pin
- base
- bottom hole

Just play with variables described on top
of [hex-standoff.scad](files/hex-standoff.scad)
file and get result which you need.
